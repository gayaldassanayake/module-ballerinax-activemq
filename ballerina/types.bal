    # either when the session has successfully returned from a call to `receive` or when the
    # message listener the session has called to process the message successfully returns.
    AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE,
    # Indicates that the client acknowledges a consumed message by calling the MessageConsumer's
    # or Caller's `acknowledge` method. Acknowledging a consumed message acknowledges all
    # messages that the session has consumed.

    # Indicates that the session lazily acknowledges the delivery of messages. This is likely to
    # result in the delivery of some duplicate messages if the JMS provider fails, so it should
    # only be used by consumers that can tolerate duplicate messages. Use of this mode can reduce
    # session overhead by minimizing the work the session does to prevent duplicates.

# + receiveTimeout - The timeout (in seconds) to wait for a message when polling. If no message
#                    arrives within this time, the receive operation returns without a message.
# + exclusive - When enabled, only this consumer can consume messages from the destination,

# + consumerType - The message consumer type (DURABLE or DEFAULT). Use DURABLE for subscriptions
#                  that should persist when the client disconnects.
